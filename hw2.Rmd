## Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

```
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```

```
abalone <- read_csv("abalone.csv")
```

```
summary(abalone)
```

### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```
abalone
abalone$age <- abalone$rings + 1.5 
summary(abalone)
```

```{r}
abalone %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60) +
  theme_bw()
```
By creating a histogram of age in abalone, we see a normal distribution with a longer tail on the right.

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

```{r}
set.seed(4167)
```

```{r}
abalone_split <- initial_split(abalone, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = age)
abalone_train <- training(abalone_split)
abalone_test <- testing(abalone_split)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

```{r}
abalone_recipe <-
  recipe(age ~ type + longest_shell + diameter + height + whole_weight + shucked_weight + viscera_weight + shell_weight, data = abalone_train) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ starts_with("type"):shucked_weight) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ longest_shell:diameter) %>% 
  step_interact(terms = ~ shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors())  
```

```{r}
abalone_recipe
```
We should not use rings to predict age because rings is essentially the outcome variable plus an intercept (1.5). We don't want our outcome variable to also be a predictor variable; the model would heavily depend on rings.

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

```{r}
lm_model <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm")
```

### Question 5

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

```{r}
lm_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(lm_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(abalone_recipe)
```

### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.

```{r}
lm_fit <- fit(lm_wflow, abalone_train)
becka <- data.frame(type = 'F', longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1)
predict(lm_fit, new_data = becka)
```
Using fit, with the given predictor variables we obtain a prediction of 20.87 years. 

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

```
install.packages("yardstick")
```

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).

```{r}
abalone_metrics <- metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae)
abalone_metrics(abalone_train_res, truth = age, 
                estimate = .pred)
```

2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).


```{r}
abalone_train_res <- predict(lm_fit, new_data = abalone_train %>% select(-age))
abalone_train_res <- bind_cols(abalone_train_res, abalone_train %>% select(age))
abalone_train_res %>% 
  head()
```

3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.

``` {r}
rmse(abalone_train_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
```
```{r}
rsq(abalone_train_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
```
```{r}
mae(abalone_train_res, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
```
The R squared value is approximately .56. We can interpret this as 56% of the data fits the regression model; 56% in variation of age can be described by the model excluding rings.
